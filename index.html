    <h3>How Else?</h3>
    <p>How else do you relieve strees but constant meditation and a disciplined mind, getting angry at yourself when you slip. I see the futility of most who preach meditation, it is simply the art of focusing one's mind on a thought or activity. That doesn't require poses, that doesn't require iphone apps, that requires the one thing which so many people lack, discipline. I think the best way to relieve stress is to just vent out what you're thinking, it's why men write in journals. I'll proceed to do this here.</p>
    <h3>Escaping</h3>
    <p>Well, I have never really liked the world I was in, so I sought refuge in other worlds. This world which the only price of admission is to be born, I simply don't like it. I like creating my own world, even if that is at the detriment to myself and this one. One of my favorite quotes is that reality is for those who can't handle science fiction. The adventurous spirit of the first cyberpunks exicites me, that there are people out that who want to create something better. Just imagine a virtual, living world of human creation. I go into VR and see its potential, it gets me excited. What's always bothered me are those petty annoyances, the noise, the moochers of this world who could never hope to create anything worthwhile, their arrogance and stupidity when they proclaim that they know better than me, that they are some how benevolent. I think of going to school and having the option to mute my classmates. Being able to read in silence in a virtual environment. Having a virtual library full of every book ever written. Being able to roam down its halls just picking them off the shelf. Being able to go to a movie theater and not having to deal with the sounds of people's feet shuffling, or of the popcorn which their munching. The ability for me to pick the movie, out of all the movies ever produced. The possibilities are endless, so close yet so far. I'm not even ashamed to admit that I want no presence in this world, I'd readily give it up if given a better alternative. I feel that one of the positives of us being quarantined are that many will start turning inwards, it's hard but once you have that mental freedom you'd be damned to give it back.</p>
    <h3>Irony</h3>
    <p>You see it's exactly those delusions, that's what I'm talking about when I said I like creating my own world. I like talking in my own language, letting others attempt to interpret it if they so wish, I got little to hide, I'm the only one which needs to understand the meaning of those words. If somebody reproaches me for it, I smile at them with a knowing smile that conveys more than can be said in words. People may see me as a loser. So be it. It's not up to me what they think. Why should it matter? They say friends are what make life worth living. I ask what sort of friends? And Why is there such a short supply of good people to be your friend? They say that I'm coldhearted, never felt a thing. I say why do you pay heed to such emotions.</p>
    <h3>Confusion</h3>
    <p>You start to ask yourself these questions and find yourself receiving no answers. You find yourself befuddled at the fact that their are no answers, the more you try to search for them the more you have the conviction that there are no absolutes. The one conviction that you do hold after that though is impoverished is the man who does no soul searching. He is the one who is barren, he is the one who never understood what it means to be human.</p>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>Some have told me I'm so secretive, but here I am typing these things for a school assignment. I have a feeling that the people who told me that never really cared about me because if they did they'd have looked a little harder. They'd have come across this. Don't know, maybe I expect too much out of people. Oh well, such is my lot.</p>
